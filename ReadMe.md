****Technologies and Languages Used******

**Backend**

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used for building the server-side application.
Express.js: A web framework for Node.js, used to create the RESTful API.
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to define schemas and interact with the database.
Validator: A library used for data validation, such as email validation.

**Frontend**
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the frontend.

**Database**
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store data. The database interactions are facilitated through Mongoose.
Postman: Used for testing and managing API endpoints and database operations during development.
Approach to ERD and Schema Implementation
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): The ERD was designed to map out the relationships between various entities such as Ground Owners, Grounds, Tournaments, Slots, Reviews, and Ratings.
Schema Implementation: Using Mongoose, we implemented schemas to model our database structure in MongoDB. Each schema represents an entity with defined fields and relationships.
JSON Usage
API Requests and Responses: JSON is used as the format for API requests and responses, allowing the frontend and backend to communicate effectively.
Database Operations: Data stored in MongoDB is in BSON (Binary JSON) format. Mongoose helps in converting JSON data to BSON and vice versa.
