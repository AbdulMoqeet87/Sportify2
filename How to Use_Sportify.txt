first go to GroundOwnerRoute.js in backend and in multer replace the given path with the path 
where you have placed frontend/Posters in your computer and same for Frontend/images,

Now just open backend folder in vscode and run using npm run dev and then open frontend folder in vscode
and run using npm run dev 

at the very end we added 'city' attribute in groundowner and User so not all grounds will work fine
only ittefaq2 will because its owner has city ....
